"""
This module provides two implementations of a circular buffer:
CircularBufferList and CircularBufferDeque.

CircularBufferList is implemented using a list as the underlying storage,
while CircularBufferDeque is implemented using a deque.
Both implementations have a fixed capacity and support enqueue
and dequeue operations.
